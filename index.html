  <section class="intro">

    Since childhood, I have had a keen interest in computers and electronics. The day I used computer for the first time, I checked every single option, had to know how everything worked. That interest brought me to the field of Engineering which further fueled my interest. The day I created my first AI Face Detection Project, I was overwhelmed. In University, I won Computer & Engineering competition, by giving the solution and implementation of a real-world problem.

  <section>
    <p>
      There has always been an innate desire in me to gain valuable knowledge, that is at the heart of revolution. Being from humble background, I started working in a restaurant to manage my educational expenses during school. Till now, I support myself by Freelancing on Fiverr. My self-motivation brought me to university where I scored scholarship to continue my studies.

    </p>

    <p>

      In this regard, I am looking forward to pursuing my field of interest to next level. I'm confident that studying in the United States would provide unparalleled learning opportunities. Also, in a diverse cultural setting, with so many options and opportunities, experience world-class academies will change my life and my future. I believe that this ‘cultural exchange program’ is the best mean of exploring knowledge and culture. 


    </p>
    <p>
      I love learning; it would be real honor and nice opportunity to study in a country with advanced technologies. I believe this opportunity will include an ideal opportunity to engage with various societies in America and let me learn from various cultures around the world.
